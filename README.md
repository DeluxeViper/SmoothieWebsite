# Smoothie Makers Full Stack Website

A Progressive Web Application (that means you can *install* the website) that brings all Smoothie Makers alike to come together, create healthy & nutritious recipes, and share them with everyone else. Developed by Abdullah Mohamed, credits to Hudson Pu for the Idea!

# TLDR

* A full-stack website created using a **Vaadin** (**Java, Javascript, CSS, HTML**) frontend with a **Spring Boot** (**Java, JPQL, Spring Data JPA**) backend with a **MySQL** database
* Utilized **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** to deploy the Spring Boot + Vaadin application web application, as well as **AWS RDS** to deploy the MYSQL database
* Leveraged User authentication (**OAuth 2.0 & Custom Auth**) and authorization using Spring Security 
* Developed a web scraper in **Python** using the **BeautifulSoup4** and **Selenium** libraries to automate parsing nutrition facts from the web and transform them into insert statements for the MySQL database
